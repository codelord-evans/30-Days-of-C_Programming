# 30-Days-of-C_Programming

Welcome to the "30-Days-of-C_Programming" repository!

This repository is a personal collection of C programming exercises that I am working on over the course of 30 days. The goal is to enhance my C programming skills and gain a deeper understanding of the language.
In the course of mastering C Programming I will build mini projects to help me grasp Concepts

## Overview

This repository contains a series of C programming exercises, each focusing on a specific concept or topic. The exercises are categorized into 30 days, with each day covering a different aspect of C programming. The exercises are carefully selected to provide a comprehensive learning experience.

## How to Use

1. Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/30-Days-of-C_Programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the Day's Folder: Each day's exercises are organized in separate folders. Begin with Day 1 and progress through the subsequent days. For example, navigate to the `Day-1` folder:
   ```
   cd 30-Days-of-C_Programming/Day-1
   ```

3. Read the Exercise Instructions: Within each day's folder, you'll find a README file that provides instructions for the exercise. Read the instructions carefully to understand the task and any additional requirements.

4. Write Your Solution: Create a new C source file or modify the existing source file provided with the exercise. Implement your solution to solve the given problem or fulfill the required functionality.

5. Test Your Solution: After writing your code, compile and run it to test its correctness and functionality. Verify that it produces the expected output and handles possible edge cases.

6. Repeat for Other Days: Once you are satisfied with your solution for the current day, move on to the next day's folder and repeat steps 3-5 for the subsequent exercises.
